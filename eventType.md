# ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>

Certainly! Let's break down the specific TypeScript type `ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>` used in the code.

`ChangeEvent` is a generic type provided by TypeScript that represents the change event in a form element, such as an input field. The generic parameter `<HTMLInputElement>` specifies the type of the element that triggered the change event.

- `ChangeEvent`: This is the generic type representing a change event. It is a generic type because it can be used with different types of HTML elements.

- `<HTMLInputElement>`: This is the generic parameter specifying the type of the element that triggered the change event. In this case, it is an input element (`HTMLInputElement`).

Putting it all together, `ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>` is a type that represents the change event specifically for an input element. When you use this type in the function signature, you are telling TypeScript that the event object passed to the function should be of this specific type, which includes properties and methods related to input elements.

By using this type, you benefit from TypeScript's static type checking, ensuring that you are handling the correct type of event and preventing potential runtime errors related to incorrect event types. It enhances code safety and helps catch errors during development.
